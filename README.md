# got-tk

Go toolkit. Bricks that every service here rewrote, extracted once.

Transport-agnostic on purpose: nothing imports chi or ConnectRPC. A package
hands back stdlib types, and each service writes its own five-line adapter.

```
go get github.com/menems/got-tk
```

## pkg/pg

Opens a `*pgxpool.Pool` from a DSN. No wrapper type, no ping: pgxpool connects
lazily, and reachability is `pkg/health`'s question.

```go
pool, err := pg.New(ctx, dsn, pg.WithMaxConns(25))
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("db: %w", err)
}
defer pool.Close()
```

`New` owns the pool size. A `pool_max_conns` in the DSN is overwritten by
`DefaultMaxConns` (10) or by `WithMaxConns`.

## pkg/health

Liveness and readiness probes as `http.HandlerFunc`. Stdlib only.

```go
mux.Handle("GET /healthz/live", health.Live())
mux.Handle("GET /healthz/ready", health.Ready(map[string]health.Checker{
    "postgres": health.CheckerFunc(pool.Ping),
}))
```

`Live` takes no dependency: a liveness probe that fails on a broken database
asks the orchestrator to restart a process that restarting will not fix.

`Ready` runs every check concurrently under one deadline (2s, `WithTimeout`).
It answers `200 {"status":"ok"}`, or `503 {"status":"unavailable","failed":
["postgres"]}`. The failing check's error text goes to the logger
(`WithLogger`), never to the response body: a probe endpoint is usually
reachable by more callers than the operator expects.
